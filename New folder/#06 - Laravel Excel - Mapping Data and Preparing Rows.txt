sometimes we need to manipulate Data
before exporting like we may want to
append something or remove something
from the data
we may also want to change the order of
the columns in the Excel sheet
we can achieve both with two methods
provided by larval XO for changing the
order of the columns we have an
interface which we can Implement called
with mapping
this interface required you to define a
method name map which returns array and
this array represents a single row of
data
let's implement this interface and
Define the method
now inside we can Define how we want
each of our row to be mapped
now let's go to the browser and see the
result we are facing an error and that's
because I'm trying to access a property
on an array
so let's fix that and retry it in the
browser
and inside the export file we can now
see that each row has only those
property that we map through
here we just have one problem that the
value of address and phone number column
are swept so let's fix that and retry
again
so that's how Map works in general
with this method we can also Define how
multiple rows should be mapped for this
we can Define array of arrays where each
internal array is a representation of a
single row
so let's define three rows and see the
output
we can see that every row is showing
exactly how we Define them to be every
second row should have the hyphens for
phone number and every third row should
have hyphens for the address
the other method is called prepare roll
for this you don't have to implement any
interface and as you might have guessed
by the name of it that it is used to
prepare the rows for export
this method is called before mapping the
data to export file even though we can
manipulate the data inside the map
method it is better to split each method
with their own single responsibility
right now we can see an error and that
is because I'm calling transform a
collection method on any array
so instead of this transform method I
will be using for each Loop
let's try now and we can see that we
have manipulated the name for each row
now we know how we can generate reports
and how we can manipulate data so before
going further ahead let's quickly look
into how we can store this Excel file on
our disk and what matters do we have for
exporting
