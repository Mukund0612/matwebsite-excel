in this video let's talk about how we
can have multiple sheets inside our
export
for this we will be exporting a file
that will have sheet for each user and
inside each of the sheet we will have
all the orders history for that specific
user
so we can simply think of a sheet as an
Excel report inside another Excel report
and following this tool we need to
create another export file and include
that inside our main export file
so now let's do some code
the first thing we are going to need is
a new export file so I will go back to
my terminal and I'll run the command to
create a new export file
and I will keep the name of the file as
user sheet Explorer

next we need to make some changes or
modification inside our main export file
so first thing I'm going to remove all
the implementation of interfaces
next I'm just gonna keep the Constructor
method and I will be clearing all other
matters
so we will get rid of all of them
now we need to implement another
interface that will allow us to have
multiple sheets inside our export the
interface is called with multiple sheets
let's Implement that
and this interface has one method which
we need to override
so let's copy paste that
this method expects us to return an
array so let's define our variable sheet
which will be an empty array and what
I'm going to do inside this method is
I'm going to Loop through each of the
data which represents a single user and
I will create a sheet
so the code will be something like this
so what I have done is I'm looping
through each of the data which
represents a single user and I'm
appending this sheet inside the array
and in the end we will return this array
now let's define a few things inside our
sheet file
first I'm going to remove this from
collection implementation and get rid of
the collection method
there are a lot of interfaces and
concerns provided by this Library so I
will be using another interface with
title and this will allow us to define
the title of our sheet
so let's Implement that
and this interface has one method which
we need to override
so let's copy paste that and Define it
but before doing that we need to have
the Constructor to receive the data so
let's define the Constructor
and a property name user
Also let's go back to our user export
and instead of passing the ID I will
pass in the user model so now we need to
define the title of our sheet and that
is going to be the username so we are
going to say regen this user name the
next thing we need to do is Define
headings for our sheet so I'm going to
copy paste this function or method and
we are also going to implement this
interface
so what I've done is I have simply added
headings based on our order stable next
we need to define the query method which
will be executed for each of the user
and retrieve the orders for the specific
user
so let's implement the
from query interface
and let's define the query method
the next thing that I'm going to do is
Define the map method so we are not
going to be showing every column
including the created add and updated ad
inside our report but instead we just
want to show the basic information so
for that let's first implement the
method with mapping
the interface Theory and Define the
method map which is going to return an
array inside this method I've just kept
the basic information like the order ID
status and amount and notes of the order
there is also one more thing that I
would like to change so let's go to our
controller
and instead of storing I'm gonna
download the file because we don't want
to store it on our storage but instead
downloading to the browser is a quicker
way to see it
now let's go to the browser and see our
report
now inside the report we can now see
that we have multiple sheets and each it
refers to one single user
and inside we can see all the orders for
that specific user
so that was all about the multiple
sheets
so now you have learned how you can
create multiple sheets in a single
export file in the next video let's take
a look at the customization of these
columns
