# Laravel Excel: Exporting Large Data with Queues

When working with large datasets, it is inefficient to make users wait for the server to respond while generating exports. Instead, you can use queues to handle export processes asynchronously, providing a more efficient and user-friendly experience.

## Introduction

When exporting large amounts of data, it is crucial to avoid making users wait for a long server response. By utilizing queues, we can improve performance and user experience by processing exports in the background.

## Why Use Queues for Exports?

- **Improved Performance:** Queues allow the server to handle export tasks asynchronously, reducing load times and server strain.
- **Better User Experience:** Users receive immediate feedback that the export has started, and they can continue other tasks while waiting.
- **Scalability:** Queues handle large datasets more efficiently, allowing for exports of thousands or even millions of records.

## Setting Up Queues in Laravel

To use queues, you need to configure your Laravel environment to use a queue driver, such as Redis, Beanstalkd, or Amazon SQS. In this guide, we'll use Redis as the queue driver.

1. **Install Redis:** Make sure Redis is installed on your system. You can follow the [Redis installation guide](https://redis.io/download) for your operating system.

2. **Update Environment File:** Open the `.env` file in your Laravel project and change the queue connection to Redis:

```env
QUEUE_CONNECTION=redis
```

3. Install Laravel Queue Package: Make sure you have installed the Laravel queue package:

```bash
composer require predis/predis
```
## Implementing Queues in Export Classes
You can implement queues in your export classes by using the `ShouldQueue` interface provided by Laravel Excel. This can be done in two ways:

### Explicit Queuing
In explicit queuing, you manually dispatch the export job from your controller. Here's an example:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use App\Exports\UserExport;
use Maatwebsite\Excel\Facades\Excel;

class UserController extends Controller
{
    public function export()
    {
        // Explicitly queue the export
        Excel::queue(new UserExport)->store('users.xlsx', 'local');

        return response()->json(['message' => 'Export has started']);
    }
}
```
### Implicit Queuing
Implicit queuing involves implementing the `ShouldQueue` interface directly in the export class. This approach is preferred for cleaner and more reusable code.

**Export Class with Implicit Queuing**
```php
<?php

namespace App\Exports;

use Maatwebsite\Excel\Concerns\FromQuery;
use Maatwebsite\Excel\Concerns\ShouldQueue;
use Maatwebsite\Excel\Concerns\WithHeadings;
use Maatwebsite\Excel\Concerns\WithMapping;
use Maatwebsite\Excel\Concerns\Exportable;
use App\Models\User;

class UserExport implements FromQuery, WithMapping, WithHeadings, ShouldQueue
{
    use Exportable;

    /**
     * Return the query for the export.
     *
     * @return \Illuminate\Database\Query\Builder
     */
    public function query()
    {
        return User::query();
    }

    /**
     * Map the data for each row.
     *
     * @param mixed $user
     * @return array
     */
    public function map($user): array
    {
        return [
            $user->id,
            $user->name,
            $user->email,
        ];
    }

    /**
     * Define the headings for the export.
     *
     * @return array
     */
    public function headings(): array
    {
        return ['ID', 'Name', 'Email'];
    }
}
```

### Controller Method
```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use App\Exports\UserExport;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

class UserController extends Controller
{
    public function export()
    {
        $export = new UserExport();

        // Store the export on the local disk
        $export->store('users.xlsx', 'local');

        return response()->json(['message' => 'Export has started']);
    }
}
```

## Storing Export Files
To store the export file, you can use the `store` method on the export instance:

```php
$export->store('users.xlsx', 'local');
```
- **local:** Stores the file in the `storage/app` directory.
- **s3:** Stores the file in an Amazon S3 bucket (requires additional configuration).

## Running the Queue Worker
To start processing queued jobs, you need to run the queue worker. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
php artisan queue:work
```

This command will start the queue worker process, which listens for jobs and executes them as they are dispatched.

## Chaining Jobs After Export
You can chain additional jobs to run after the export is complete using the chain method. This is useful for sending notifications or performing other actions once the export is finished.

### Example: Chaining a Notification Job
1. **Create a Job:**

    First, create a new job class using the Artisan command:

    ```bash
    php artisan make:job NotifyUserOfCompletedExport
    ```
2. **Define the Job Logic:**

    In the NotifyUserOfCompletedExport class, implement the handle method:

    ```php
    <?php

    namespace App\Jobs;

    use Illuminate\Bus\Queueable;
    use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldQueue;
    use Illuminate\Queue\InteractsWithQueue;
    use Illuminate\Queue\SerializesModels;
    use App\Models\User;
    use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Mail;

    class NotifyUserOfCompletedExport implements ShouldQueue
    {
        use Queueable, InteractsWithQueue, SerializesModels;

        protected $user;

        /**
         * Create a new job instance.
         *
         * @return void
         */
        public function __construct(User $user)
        {
            $this->user = $user;
        }

        /**
         * Execute the job.
         *
         * @return void
         */
        public function handle()
        {
            // Logic to send email notification to the user
            Mail::to($this->user->email)->send(new \App\Mail\ExportCompleted($this->user));
        }
    }
    ```
3. **Chain the Job in the Controller:**

    Update the export method to chain the job:

    ```php
    <?php

    namespace App\Http\Controllers;

    use App\Exports\UserExport;
    use App\Jobs\NotifyUserOfCompletedExport;
    use Illuminate\Http\Request;

    class UserController extends Controller
    {
        public function export()
        {
            $user = auth()->user(); // Example: Get the authenticated user

            $export = new UserExport();

            // Store the export and chain the notification job
            $export->store('users.xlsx', 'local')->chain([
                new NotifyUserOfCompletedExport($user)
            ]);

            return response()->json(['message' => 'Export has started']);
        }
    }
    ```
### Result
The chained jobs will be executed in the order they are defined, following the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle.

## Handling Errors in Queued Exports
To handle errors in your queued exports, you can define a failed method in your export class. This method will be called whenever an exception occurs during the export process.

### Example: Handling Export Errors
```php
<?php

namespace App\Exports;

use Maatwebsite\Excel\Concerns\FromQuery;
use Maatwebsite\Excel\Concerns\ShouldQueue;
use Maatwebsite\Excel\Concerns\WithHeadings;
use Maatwebsite\Excel\Concerns\WithMapping;
use Maatwebsite\Excel\Concerns\Exportable;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldQueue;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldQueue;
use Throwable;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Log;
use App\Models\User;

class UserExport implements FromQuery, WithMapping, WithHeadings, ShouldQueue
{
    use Exportable;

    // Other methods and interfaces

    /**
     * Handle failed export job.
     *
     * @param Throwable $exception
     */
    public function failed(Throwable $exception)
    {
        // Log the exception or perform other error handling
        Log::error('Export failed: ' . $exception->getMessage());

        // Optionally, notify the user of the failure
        // Mail::to($user->email)->send(new \App\Mail\ExportFailed($user, $exception));
    }
}
```

### Explanation
- **Logging Errors:** The `Log::error` method is used to record the exception details in the application logs.
- **User Notifications:** You can also notify users about the failure by sending an email or other notifications.

## Conclusion
In this guide, we explored how to use queues with Laravel Excel to efficiently handle large data exports:

- Improved performance and user experience by processing exports asynchronously.
- Implemented implicit queuing with the ShouldQueue interface.
- Chained additional jobs for notifications and other tasks.
- Handled errors gracefully with the failed method.

By following these steps, you can create scalable and efficient export solutions that provide a better experience for your users.
